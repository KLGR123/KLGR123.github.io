A paper was produced and submitted to the NIPS 2023 conference and has been rejected. The paper investigates a data augmentation application of the mainstream diffusion model on the small sample task of images. It mainly proposes the Meta-DM framework and verifies that several mainstream algorithms combined with Meta-DM can significantly improve their performance and achieve SOTA.
