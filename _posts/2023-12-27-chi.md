CHI conference is called ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which belongs to CCF-A category. CHI has an open review channel for alt.CHI papers, which allows anyone to review papers under real names.

I have selected one of the papers related to the evaluation of large models, which is the work of the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics at Harvard University, entitled Contextual Evaluation of AI: a New Gold Standard, which focuses on the challenges of evaluating AI systems in environments dominated by personal backgrounds, and proposes a new gold standard for evaluation methods. standard. The authors call for task-time evaluation of AI systems and emphasize the need for user evaluation to assess the usability and utility of these systems. The article challenges traditional evaluation methods and proposes a new evaluation standard that emphasizes the importance of a user-driven approach.
