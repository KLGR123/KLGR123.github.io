We won 2023 "Shanghai Lingang Cup" Artificial Intelligence Global Innovation Competition and Hong Kong and Macau Student Maker Marathon Grand Final Gold Award! ðŸŽ‰
The project designs the "Yang Jian" system based on the competition theme. Based on the traditional knowledge retrieval enhancement of open-source models, it innovatively utilizes web-based retrieval and analysis learning tools (search term rewriting, RAG, CoT as instruction fine-tuning enhancement, etc.), and achieves a better result of the hallucination detection task at a low cost.
