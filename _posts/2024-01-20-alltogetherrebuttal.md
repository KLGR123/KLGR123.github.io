This paper was submitted to COLING 2024 based on the "Class of Talent" Innovation Fund Program. The paper investigates the performance and evaluation of intelligences based on a generalized LLM in accomplishing the Web Navigation task, and designs the AllTogether method to enhance the language grounding capability of the pretrained language model.

My inital total score was 4/3/2, and it's not very high. I gave detailed replies for all reviewers.
