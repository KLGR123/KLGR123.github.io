The company is an overseas startup located in Canada, which wants to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) applications in several fields based on the hot technology of large language model. During my internship, I collaborated with several colleagues to develop and deploy web-based AGI intelligences for the Kapwing video editing website and the Instantly email management website based on the techniques of prompt engineering and tool learning.
