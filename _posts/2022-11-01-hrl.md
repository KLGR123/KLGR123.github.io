The title of this graduation design is "Research on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Based on Option". After thorough research and thesis study, I implemented an algorithm improvement based on the mainstream IOC algorithm, and tested it in multiple environments for specific evaluation metrics, and verified the improvement of reward scores and interpretability metrics.
