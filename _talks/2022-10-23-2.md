The research proposes a new paradigm for large models to implement reasoning about the physical world Mind's Eye, by getting information from real simulations of physical problems in the Mujoco physics engine, and inputting auxiliary information along with the problems themselves to enable large models, the improvement in UTOPIA baseline is significant and can be done so that small models plus simulations can outperform large models after the effect improvement is significant.
