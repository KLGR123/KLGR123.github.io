title: "BM24 at COLIEE 2024: Case and Statute Retrieval by Semantic Similarity"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper3
excerpt: "Automatic retrieval techniques are playing a more and more role in legal processes. COLIEE, well-known as an international competition interested in novel methods in legal text retrieval, releases Legal Case Retrieval as their task1 and Statute Law Retrieval as their task3. This paper reports team BM24â€™s methods to solve task1 and task3. We use matched case / statute pairs provided in the training set to fine tune an embedding model which is then used to build a vector store for semantic retrieval. Specifically, for task 1, we summarize the long case text into segments and choose one informative segment to represent the whole case text to preprocess the long case texts."
