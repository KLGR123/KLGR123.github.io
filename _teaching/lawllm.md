This project mainly relies on the technical route of prompt learning and partial parameter fine-tuning of open-source large language models to realize a large-model intelligent assistant in the legal vertical field for professionals and the public, targeting legal documents, Q&A and legal data. I am responsible for framework design, deployment fine-tuning, evaluation session and interaction design.
